Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a ReAct Agent leveraging Groq technology for planning, execution, and observation. The agent integrates reasoning and acting capabilities to solve complex tasks effectively by planning its actions, executing them, and observing the outcomes for iterative improvements.

Features

Groq-Enhanced Reasoning:

Utilize Groq technology for efficient computation and task management.

Planning and Execution:

Formulate step-by-step action plans and execute them systematically.

Observation and Feedback:

Observe the results of actions and refine subsequent steps based on feedback.

Workflow

Task Initialization:

The user defines the task or query for the agent.

Planning Phase:

The agent formulates a plan of action based on the input.

Execution Phase:

Actions are carried out as per the plan using Groqâ€™s computational power.

Observation Phase:

The outcomes of executed actions are observed and analyzed.

Iteration:

The agent refines its approach based on observations and repeats the cycle if necessary.
